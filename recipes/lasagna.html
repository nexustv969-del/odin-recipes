      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta sheets, rich
      sauce, flavorful filling, and melted cheese. Known for its comforting
      taste and hearty texture, it is one of the most popular homemade meals,
      perfect for both family dinners and special occasions. The main feature of
      lasagna is its layered structure, where each layer adds depth and balance
      to the overall flavor. It is typically baked until the cheese forms a
      golden crust, then allowed to rest for a few minutes so the layers set
      properly and the flavors become even more harmonious.
