      An omelette is a quick and simple dish made from eggs, milk, and basic
      seasonings. It is light, nutritious, and perfect for breakfast or a fast
      meal during the day. The eggs are whisked and cooked in a pan until soft
      and fluffy, creating a smooth texture and mild flavor. It can also be
      easily customized with cheese, vegetables, or herbs.
