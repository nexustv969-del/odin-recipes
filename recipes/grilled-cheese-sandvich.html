      A grilled cheese sandwich is a classic comfort food made with toasted
      bread and melted cheese. It is crispy on the outside, warm and gooey on
      the inside, making it a popular quick snack or light meal. The sandwich is
      cooked in a pan until golden brown, allowing the cheese to melt evenly.
      Its simplicity and rich taste make it a timeless and easy-to-make recipe.
